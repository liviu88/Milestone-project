                    a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show
                    of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series,
                    Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as he was the only
                    Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still
                    had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's
                    standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees
                    recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream Believer".

                    Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became
                    the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show.
                    He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able
                    to mime credibly, but eventually was taught how to play properly.
                    By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was
                    competent enough to play the drums himself. He learned to play
                    right-handed and left-footed because of a leg disease called
                    Perthes making his right leg weak.

                    to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock
                    band The Monkees, created for the television situation comedy
                    of the same name. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert
                    Gottfried's podcast, someone showed him a copy of the famous press
                    advertisement asking for "four insane boys" so he applied for the job.
                    Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blase when he auditioned. 
                    He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep 
                    his hair out of his eyes.

                    proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play
                    their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception,
                    playing what he described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's
                    song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from their first album. He subsequently
                    played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments
                    on their recordings. He also co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the
                    closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's Sake".
