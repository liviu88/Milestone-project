            <p>Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings<br />
                Of the bluebird as she sings<br />
                The six-o'clock alarm would never ring<br />
                But six rings and I rise<br />
                Wipe the sleep out of my eyes<br />
                The shaving razor's cold and it stings<br />
                Cheer up sleepy Jean<br />
                Oh, what can it mean to a<br />
                Daydream believer and a<br />
                Homecoming queen?
                You once thought of me<br />
                As a white knight on his steed<br />
                Now you know how happy I can be<br />
                Oh, our good time starts and ends<br />
                Without all I want to spend<br />
                But how much, baby, do we really need?<br />
                Cheer up sleepy Jean<br />
                Oh, what can it mean to a<br />
                Daydream believer and a<br />
                Homecoming queen?<br />
                Cheer up sleepy Jean<br />
                Oh, what can it mean to a<br />
                Daydream believer and a<br />
                Homecoming queen?<br />
                Cheer up sleepy Jean<br />
                Oh, what can it mean to a<br />
                Daydream believer and a<br />
                Homecoming queen?<br />
                Cheer up sleepy Jean<br />

            <p>Take the last train to Clarksville<br />
                And I'll meet you at the station<br />
                You can be there by four-thirty<br />
                'Cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow<br />
                Oh, no, no, no<br />
                Oh, no, no, no<br />

                And I must see you again<br />
                We'll have one more night together<br />
                Till the morning brings my train and I must go<br />
                Oh, no, no, no<br />

                We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses<br />
                And a bit of conversation<br />
                Oh, no, no, no<br />

                Take the last train to Clarksville<br />
                Now I must hang up the phone<br />
                I can't hear you in this noisy railroad station all alone<br />
                I'm feeling low<br />
                Oh, no, no, no<br />
                Oh, no, no, no<br />
                And I don't know if I'm ever coming home<br />
                Oh<br />
                Take the last train to Clarksville<br />
                And I'll meet you at the station<br />
                You can be here by four-thirty<br />

            Meant for someone else but not for me<br />
            Love was out to get me<br />
            That's the way it seemed<br />

            I couldn't leave her if I tried<br />
            I thought love was more or less a giving thing<br />
